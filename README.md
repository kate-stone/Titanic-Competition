# Kaggle Competition: Predicting Survival on the Titanic

The RMS Titanic sank in the early hours of 15-Apr-1912 taking 1502 lives with it. It remains one of the most haunting tragedies of modern history and a cautionary tale against sidestepping important safety countermeasures. 

While luck certainly played a role in gaining a life boat seat, it seems some passengers had a better chance than others. 

In this notebook I'll experiment with different machine learning models to predict whether or not a passenger survived based on their sex, age, class, fare and other factors. After identifying the best model, I'll submit my predictions to the Kaggle competition to compare with the test data. 

The dataset and competition information is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
